 🏥 Hospital Analytics Dashboard (SQL + Power BI)

📌 Project Overview  
This project is an end-to-end data analytics solution for a Hospital Management System.  
Data was cleaned and structured using SQL 
Interactive dashboards were created in Power BI  
Provides insights into patient care, treatment outcomes, and hospital performance  

The goal of this project is to help hospital management make data-driven decisions regarding patient treatment, costs, and satisfaction.  

📊 Dashboard Features  
  KPIs Cards- 
   👥 Total Patients  
   🛏️ Average Length of Stay  
   😊 Patient Satisfaction  
   🩺 Active Patients  
   💰 Average Treatment Cost  

  Visualizations- 
    Patient Count & Treatment Cost by Condition  
    Procedure-wise Satisfaction & Patient Count  
    Treatment Outcome Distribution  
    Average Cost per Procedure  
    Patients by Age Group  
    Gender & Condition-based Filters  


 🛠️ Tools Used  
  SQL – Data Cleaning & Preparation  
  Power BI – Data Visualization & Dashboarding  
  Excel – Initial dataset storage  


📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains hospital records with columns such as:  
 Patient_ID  
 Age, Gender  
 Condition, Procedure  
 Cost, Treatment Outcome  
 Patient Satisfaction, Length of Stay  



🚀 Key Insights  
- Most patients belong to the 51–65 age group 
- The highest cost is associated with heart-related conditions 
- Recovered patients (60%) are higher compared to stable patients  
- Procedures like Surgery & Radiation Therapy contribute to higher costs  
- Patient satisfaction varies significantly across procedures  


📢 Conclusion  
This project demonstrates how SQL + Power BI can be used together to create meaningful insights from healthcare data.  
Such dashboards can help hospitals monitor performance, reduce costs, and improve patient satisfaction.
